# Strategy

## Vision

main.menu is the place you go to find software for anything. Chess apps, terminal emulators, DAWs, VPNs — all browsable in one place with honest descriptions, OS filtering, and direct links. No ads, no sponsored rankings, no bullshit.

**Primary audience**: AI agents and developers. Agents need verified URLs (they hallucinate), structured metadata (JSON with OS/tags/category), and current maintenance status. Humans benefit from honest curation without SEO spam.

**Secondary audience**: Power users and technical decision-makers who want to compare options without wading through SEO-optimized listicles.

**North star**: If an agent or human asks "what's the best X for Y?", main.menu should have a useful, accurate answer with a working link.

## Core Principle: Task-First Categories

Categories describe **what a tool does**, not what language it's in. An agent thinks "I need to parse HTML" not "I need a Python library." Language is a tag/filter, not a category.

**Wrong:** Python Libraries, Rust Crates, Go Libraries, JavaScript Libraries
**Right:** HTTP Clients, Web Scraping, Image Processing, Data Validation, CLI Building

A single category page shows ALL options across ecosystems so you can compare (e.g., HTTP Clients shows requests, axios, reqwest, httpx, curl together).

### Task-Based Category Mapping (for library restructure)

| Task Category | Entries |
|---|---|
| HTTP Clients | requests, httpx, axios, reqwest, curl, wget |
| Web Scraping & Parsing | beautifulsoup4, cheerio |
| Data Analysis | pandas, numpy, polars, jq, duckdb |
| Image Processing | pillow, sharp, imagemagick, opencv |
| Media Processing | ffmpeg |
| Web Frameworks | flask, axum, gin, echo, fiber, go-chi (+ merge with existing Web Frameworks) |
| Database ORMs | sqlalchemy, prisma, gorm |
| Data Validation & Serialization | pydantic, zod, serde |
| CLI Building | click, clap, cobra |
| Async & Concurrency | tokio, rayon |
| Logging & Diagnostics | tracing, zap |
| Error Handling | anyhow |
| Real-time Communication | socket-io |
| Date & Time | date-fns |
| File Search & Navigation | fzf, ripgrep, fd, bat |
| Terminal & Shell | tmux |
| Document Conversion | pandoc |
| Utilities | lodash |

Categories that are already task-based (keep as-is): Testing Frameworks, Linters & Formatters, AI/ML Libraries, CI/CD Tools, Data Processing, Databases, APIs & Services

Language goes in `tags[]` for filtering (e.g., tags: ["python", "http"]).

## Long-Term Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current — Target: 2 weeks)
**Theme: Make the existing site polished and agent-readable.**

#### 1A. Design Overhaul — Make It Sleek
The site is functional but visually flat. Every card looks the same. There is no visual hierarchy beyond the category sidebar. To make someone bookmark this and come back:

- **Card redesign**: Add subtle category-colored left borders or top accents to cards so they are visually scannable. Consider small software icons/favicons next to names.
- **Typography upgrade**: The system font stack is fine but the hierarchy is weak. Increase contrast between card names (bolder, slightly larger) and descriptions. Use a tighter line-height on card names.
- **Header refinement**: The stat row is good. Add a subtle gradient or animated accent on the "MAIN MENU" title. Consider a brief animated counter on page load.
- **Search UX**: Add keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K) to focus search. Show result count while typing. Add search highlighting in card text. Consider instant category/tag suggestions as you type.
- **Detail panel**: Add a proper software icon/logo placeholder. Show "Similar software" suggestions at the bottom. Add a "copy link" button. Improve the tag display with better spacing.
- **Dark/Light mode**: Add a toggle. The current dark theme is good; create a corresponding light theme with warm tones. Persist preference in localStorage.
- **Animations**: Add subtle staggered fade-in on cards when filtering. Smooth the detail panel slide-in. Add a skeleton loading state.
- **Mobile**: The mobile experience drops the sidebar entirely. The peek-bar is clever but undiscoverable. Add a visible "Filter" button. Test touch interactions.
- **Footer**: Add a minimal footer with: "Curated directory — no ads, no sponsored rankings", link count, last updated date, link to the data repository.
- **Favicon**: The current SVG favicon is functional. Consider a cleaner icon — a simple stylized "M" or hamburger menu icon.

**Priority order for designer**: Search UX (Cmd+K, result count) > Card redesign (category accents) > Dark/light toggle > Detail panel improvements > Mobile filter button > Footer > Animations

#### 1B. Agent Discoverability — Make It Crawlable
The current site renders everything client-side from `data.js`. A crawler or agent hitting `index.html` sees empty divs. This is the single biggest problem for the stated primary audience.

- **Structured data (JSON-LD)**: Add schema.org `SoftwareApplication` markup for every entry, embedded in the HTML. Include name, url, operatingSystem, applicationCategory, offers (pricing). This is the highest-impact change for search engines and agents.
- **Semantic HTML**: Replace the generic `div.card` grid with `<article>` elements. Add `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>` landmarks. Use `<h2>` for card names, `<p>` for descriptions.
- **Meta tags**: The current `<meta description>` is generic. Generate a dynamic description with entry/category counts. Add Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing.
- **Server-side rendering / static generation**: The ideal end state is that `index.html` contains all entries as visible HTML, not just loaded via JS. Options:
  - **Quick win**: Have `build.py` inject a `<noscript>` block or hidden semantic HTML section containing all entries as a structured list. Agents and crawlers see it; JS-capable browsers use the interactive version.
  - **Medium-term**: Generate static category pages (`/category/cli-tools/index.html`) with pre-rendered entry lists. Good for SEO, good for agents that want to browse by topic.
  - **Long-term**: If traffic justifies it, add a lightweight static site generator step to `build.py`.
- **`/api/` endpoint**: Serve the raw JSON at a stable URL. Options:
  - Simplest: Just make `data.js` also available as `api/v1/catalog.json` (pure JSON, no `window.SOFTWARE=` wrapper). `build.py` can generate both files.
  - Add `api/v1/categories.json` (list of categories with entry counts).
  - Add `api/v1/entry/{id}.json` (individual entry lookup — can be pre-generated static files).
- **`llms.txt`**: Create a manifest file at `/llms.txt` that describes the site purpose, data format, and how to access the catalog. Format:
  ```
  # main.menu
  > Universal software directory. 290+ entries across 42 categories.

  ## API
  - Full catalog: /api/v1/catalog.json
  - Schema: /schema.json

  ## Categories
  [list of categories with counts]

  ## Entry Format
  Each entry has: id, name, description, url, category, os[], pricing, tags[], source (optional)
  ```
- **Sitemap**: Generate `sitemap.xml` from `build.py`. Include the main page and all category pages (once they exist). Low priority until we have actual category pages.

**Priority order for builder**: JSON-LD structured data > `api/v1/catalog.json` generation > `llms.txt` > Semantic HTML refactor > `<noscript>` fallback > Static category pages > Sitemap

### Phase 2: Scale (Weeks 3-6)
**Theme: Get to 500+ entries, improve metadata, harden quality.**

#### 2A. Catalog Expansion to 500+
Current: 290 entries across 42 categories. Path to 500+:

**New categories to add (estimated 120+ entries):**
- Build Tools (8): webpack, Vite, esbuild, Rollup, Turbopack, Parcel, Gradle, Maven

**Expand thin categories (estimated 30+ entries):**
- File Managers (4 -> 8): add Dolphin, Thunar, Double Commander, Midnight Commander
- Password Managers (4 -> 8): add Dashlane, NordPass, Enpass, KeePassXC
- Chess (5 -> 7): add Lichess mobile, chess24
- Cloud Storage (5 -> 8): add Mega, iCloud, Tresorit
- VPN (5 -> 8): add Tailscale, Wireguard, ZeroTier
- Database Tools (5 -> 7): add DataGrip, Beekeeper Studio

#### 2B. Enhanced Metadata
Add new optional fields to the schema to increase usefulness for agents:

- **`last_verified`** (date): When was this entry last checked for accuracy? Agents and users can trust recent entries more.
- **`maintenance_status`** (enum: active/maintenance/deprecated/archived): Critical signal. An agent should not recommend archived software.
- **`popularity`** (enum: niche/moderate/popular/dominant): Rough signal of adoption. "Popular" = most developers have heard of it. "Dominant" = category leader.
- **`license`** (string): SPDX identifier (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0, proprietary, etc.). Agents need this to recommend software for commercial use.
- **`language`** (string): Primary programming language or ecosystem (python, javascript, rust, go, etc.). Enables queries like "find a Python HTTP library."
- **`alternatives`** (array of IDs): Cross-references to similar entries. Enables "see also" in the detail panel and agent recommendations.

These fields should be optional in schema.json and backfilled gradually. `last_verified` can be auto-set by the skeptic during verification cycles.

#### 2C. Quality Automation
- **URL health checker**: Script that hits every URL in the catalog and flags 404s, redirects, and timeouts. Run weekly.
- **Duplicate detection**: Check for entries with very similar names or URLs across data files.
- **Schema validation in CI**: If we add a GitHub repo, run `jsonschema` validation on every PR.
- **Freshness alerts**: Flag entries where `last_verified` is older than 90 days.

### Phase 3: Growth (Weeks 7-12)
**Theme: Get to 1000+ entries, community contributions, monetization.**

#### 3A. Catalog Expansion to 1000+
At 500+ entries with solid metadata, the catalog becomes genuinely useful as a reference. To reach 1000+:

- **Automated discovery**: Script that pulls trending repos from GitHub, top packages from PyPI/npm/crates.io, and suggests new entries for curator review.
- **Community submissions**: Simple GitHub issue template or Google Form where anyone can suggest entries. Curator reviews and adds.
- **Vertical deep-dives**: Pick 5-10 categories and go deep. For example, "Python Libraries" could have 50+ entries (web frameworks, data science, DevOps, testing, etc.). This makes main.menu the definitive reference for that vertical.

#### 3B. Static Category Pages
Generate `/category/{slug}/index.html` for each category. Benefits:
- SEO: Each page ranks for "[category] tools" searches.
- Agent navigation: An agent can request `/category/python-libraries/` and get a focused list.
- Linkability: Users can share a direct link to a category.
- Pre-rendered: No JS required to see the content.

Each category page should include: category description, entry count, filterable list of entries, links to related categories.

#### 3C. Monetization (Careful)
The site's value proposition is honest curation. Monetization must not compromise this.

- **Affiliate links**: Where available (cloud services, paid tools), use affiliate URLs. Clearly mark them. Never let affiliate availability influence inclusion or ranking.
- **Sponsored listings**: Allow paid "featured" placement with a clear "Sponsored" label. Limit to 1 per category. Never in search results.
- **Donations**: Add a simple "Support this project" link (GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi). Low friction.
- **API access tiers**: If the API becomes popular, offer a free tier (rate-limited) and a paid tier for commercial use.

**Deprioritize**: Ads (ruins the aesthetic and trust), premium content (all data should be free), user accounts (complexity not justified yet).

#### 3D. Agent Integration Protocol
Define a standard way for agents to interact with main.menu:

- **Discovery**: Agent reads `llms.txt` to understand the site.
- **Search**: Agent queries `api/v1/catalog.json` and filters locally, or uses `api/v1/search?q=...` if we add server-side search later.
- **Recommendation**: Agent uses `popularity`, `maintenance_status`, and `alternatives` fields to make informed suggestions.
- **Verification**: Agent checks `last_verified` date and `url` to ensure freshness.
- **Feedback loop**: Agents can report broken links or suggest entries via a simple API endpoint (future).

### Phase 4: Platform (Months 3-6)
**Theme: Become the reference that agents and humans default to.**

- **Comparison pages**: Auto-generated "X vs Y" pages for popular alternatives (e.g., "PostgreSQL vs MySQL").
- **Ecosystem maps**: Visual graphs showing how tools relate (e.g., "Python web stack: Django + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery").
- **Version tracking**: Monitor release feeds for tracked software. Show "latest version" and "last release date."
- **User reviews/ratings**: Lightweight — maybe just thumbs up/down or a 1-5 rating. No text reviews (too hard to moderate).
- **Embeddable widgets**: Let blogs and docs embed a main.menu card for any software entry.

## Current Priorities (Updated 2026-03-12)

1. **Agent discoverability** — JSON-LD structured data, `api/v1/catalog.json`, `llms.txt`, semantic HTML. This is the #1 gap: our primary audience (agents) cannot effectively consume the site.
2. **Design polish** — Search UX (Cmd+K), card redesign with category accents, dark/light toggle. Make it feel like a product, not a prototype.
3. **Catalog expansion** — Target 500 entries. Add 15 new categories (Build Tools, DevOps, Privacy, API Tools, etc.). Expand 6 thin categories.
4. **Enhanced metadata** — Add `maintenance_status`, `last_verified`, `license`, `popularity`, `language`, `alternatives` to schema. Backfill gradually.
5. **Data quality** — URL health checker script, fix skeptic-reported issues (Neofetch archived, Process Explorer ID).
6. **Monetization exploration** — Affiliate links for paid tools, donation link. Do not compromise editorial independence.

## Deprioritized

- User accounts / submissions (Phase 3 at earliest)
- Server-side search (not needed until 1000+ entries)
- Comparison pages and ecosystem maps (Phase 4)
- Version tracking (Phase 4)
- User reviews/ratings (Phase 4)
- Full static site generator migration (not needed while single-page works)
